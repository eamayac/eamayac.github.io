Welcome!
------
I'm a Master student in Economics at [Universidad de San Andrés](https://udesa.edu.ar/). I also hold a Bachelor in Economics from [Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú](https://www.pucp.edu.pe/). 

My main research interests are applied microeconomics, political economy and gender economics.
